From November 22, 2022 to now, 0.1 beta to 4.0 alpha, Mineflayer to Node-Minecraft-Protocol. I have enjoyed all the new people i have met throughout the development of the bot back to the days when the bot used mineflayer for most of its lifespan to the present as it now uses node-minecraft-protocol. Its about time for me to tell how development went in the bot well here it is, back in 0.1 beta of the bot it was skidded off of menbot 1.0 reason why? Well because LoginTimedout gave me the bot when ayunboom was still a thing and he helped throughout that time period bot and when 1.0 beta came around he he just stopped helping me on it why? because he had servers to run so yeah but anyway back then i didnt know what skidded like i do now so i thought i could get away with but i was wrong ðŸ’€. Early names considered for the bot were &6&lParkerBot &4&lDEMONBot &b&lWoomyBot &b&lBoyfriendBot,&r i kept the name &b&lBoyfriendBot&r throughout most of the early development but i got sick and tired of being harassed about the name being told it was gay but people really didnt know what it meant did they? It was referenced to Boyfriend from Friday Night Funkinâ€™ so right around 1.0 released i renamed it to &b&lFNFBoyfriend&4&lBot &rand already 2.0 changed it to &5&lFNF&b&lBoyfriend&4&lBot &rand luckily avoided the harassment when i changed it i love coding and i want to learn how to code more thank you all!')
